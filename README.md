## FireFile Server Edition

Firefile is a Firebug extension that allows you to save the CSS files edited with firebug live to your web server by transfering it to a server- side script, which then handles css saving.
FireFile remembers all modifications done to a website (all modified css files) and, by clicking on the lower- right FireFile icon, allows you to bulk save or download all changes made.

## INSTALLATION

1) Download the latest version from github (Download- Button) place firefile.php somewhere on your webserver.
2) Next, open firefile.php in your webbrowser and follow the instructions there.
